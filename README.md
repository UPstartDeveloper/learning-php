# Learning PHP, React, and Others

A collections of mini-projects using different web technologies outlined below. 

## PHP

For this I'll be using the website of my local *imambargah* as a chance to learn some PHP.

To start working on this part of the repo, please ensure how have Apache installed and running your web server.

### OSX
For Mac users, you can install Apache by installing the `brew` package `apachectl`.

Then to run the web server, you may use the following command from Terminal:

```
sudo apachectl restart 
```

You may be asked to provide the password for your machine.

Then, you are ready to navigate to whatever `localhost` URL which our web app is being served from!
